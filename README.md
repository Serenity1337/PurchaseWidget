In order to run the project:

1. If you haven't installed the dependencies, you will have to run ''npm install'' command in the terminal.
2. To run the project, you will have to run ''npm run start'' command in the terminal.

The project consists mainly of 4 parts:

1. First part is selecting the products you would like to buy, you will be required to select atleast 1 product.
2. Second part is filling your contact form, all fields are required to be filled.
3. Third part is reviewing your order and making sure everything is fine, then completing the order by clicking 'checkout'
4. Fourth part is the order completed, but if you would like so, you could create a new order.

In steps 2,3 you will have an option to go to a previous form in case you'd like to change your details. The details will persist as well.
